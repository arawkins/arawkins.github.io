            <h2 class="">2001-2004: BC Web</h2>
            <p>My first web job was at a company called BC Web, based in Smithers, BC, Canada. I had the chance to work on a wide variety of projects here, including brochures, posters, websites, business cards, and more. There was also an in-house
                internet cafe that we ran, and apple computer sales. Most of our clients were from across Northern BC. We did websites for tourism businesses, local governments, community organizations, and more. It was a fantastic place to work. I
                was able to learn a tonne on the job.</p>

            <p>My work was mostly focused on graphic design. I was using Adobe and Macromedia tools for my designs, and then translating those designs onto the web. Our sites were coded and laid out using html tables. We would slice apart photoshop
                and/or illustrator designs, and the place them in table cells. Flash was in the picture, but generally reserved for clients with larger budgets and a desire for something, well. Flashy. At this point, I was not doing much coding, just
                HTML.</p>

            <p>Around 2003 I began working remotely for BC Web in Victoria BC, and also began doing some freelance work. A year or two later, the company BC Web would split into two, with the web and design department of the business breaking off to
                become BC Designworks. I continued working for Designworks for a bit longer, before taking a break to return to school and do some travelling.</p>
