            <p>I have been working as a web designer and developer since 2001. I’ve had the chance to work on a wide variety of different projects. I’ve listed a bunch of them below; unfortunately much of the stuff I’ve worked on is no longer online, but I do still have screenshots! In cases where the sites are still online, I’ve provided high end web links to whisk you across the internet to view them directly.</p>
            <h2>Spark Design Co. (2008-2018)</h2>
            <p>The bulk of my most recent work was done for the company Spark Design Co. On most of these projects, I was responsible for front end and back end coding, building css and html templates and integrating them with customized CMS installations using Expression Engine. </p>

            <h2>University of Guelph (2006-2007)</h2>
            <p>I served as a staff Web Designer at the University of Guelph, where I worked on a variety of internal website projects, including a historical walking tour, fundraising initiatives, and updates to the University homepage. Web standards and accessibility were a must. </p>
