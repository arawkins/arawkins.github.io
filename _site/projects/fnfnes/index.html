            <p>FNFNES: First Nations Food, Nutrition and Environment Study. My primary responsibilities included developing the CSS and HTML templates on the front-end, building the Expression Engine CMS back-end, and fully integrating all front-end and back-end code.</p>
<p>There were two other major features on this site. The first was that it was a fully bilingual site, requiring the ability to toggle back and forth between English and French at any time. This required dedicated content fields in the back end for each language, and appropriate front-end code to switch and maintain the user's chosen language.</p>
<p>Another major feature was the survey map. As researchers completed surveys across Canada, they could log into the site and input their survey data. This data included latitude and longitude coordinates for each survey. I developed an interactive map using Adobe Flash that pulled in these cooridnates and plotted them on a map of canada, allowing site visitors to browse survey data by location on the map.</p>
