<p>Drive your boat through an obstacle course while towing a wakeboarder. Keep your boarder on his feet to score extra time. My entry into the <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Contests/agame/">2006 Donationcoder.com accessible games competition</a>. The competition required all entrants to produce either a switch game (a game requiring only one input), or a game with no visuals (ie. audio only).</p>
