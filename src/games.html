<p>Since around 2005, I have been developing and publishing my own games as the company Rawkins Games. My biggest project was the game Dolphin Up, which has been released across multiple platforms, and continues to be popular. All of my released games are listed below. Some of the older games are built with Flash, which may or may not work in your browser. </p>
